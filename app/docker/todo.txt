cyber-dojo script needs new commands to push/pull data sets from path/url (see notes.txt too)
  o) cyber-dojo volume create --name=VOL --git=URL
     chosen manifests need auto_pull:true
     this needs to be added as new property of manifest
     then add to cyber-dojo-languages repo
     then recreate default_languages vol
  o) cyber-dojo up
     pulls any docker image not already pulled whose manifest is auto_pull:true
  o) cyber-dojo volume inspect VOL <------
  o) lhs,rhs titles in setup page
  o) 2 tabs in setup page
  o) cyber-dojo volume pull VOL

-----------------------------------

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"
  export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT="/home/docker/data/katas"

instructions refactored to be manifest'ed
  use disk[path].each_rdir('instructions') in its make_cache()
  Only instructions file would be shown on 2nd setup page.

Put two tabs onto the setup/show page.
  One tab for languages, this will have a second step for instructions.
  One tab for exercises.
  Don't put these on the outer top left position.
  Make the tabs as central as possible.
  Below the title [create a practice session]

If there are no images installed handle setup pages gracefully.
  At the moment you get a nil exception from the chooser I think.

Now that exercises are manifested (like Languages) how does that
impact the [docker pull IMAGE] since the catalog listed is
a language catalog? Perhaps
$ ./cyber-dojo languages catalog
$ ./cyber-dojo exercises catalog

Will instructions need to be in the commands somewhere since presumably
the instructions data-set will be in a git repo (just as languages and
exercises will be)

With James

Setup the new code on James machine.
  o) pull from branch drop-katas-data-container
  o) create new web image
  o) create data folder on docker server from your exercises.
  o) set hard-wired paths to data folders at top of cyber-dojo script.


Agree labels to use for 2 columns in setup/show_exercises page.
  ideally this would become configurable somehow.
  maybe a manifest.json file in the top level folder?
