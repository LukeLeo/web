cyber-dojo script needs new commands to push/pull data sets from path/url
  see notes.txt

cyber-dojo update command needs to update cyber-dojo script itself.
  make cyber-dojo a super-thin outer 'handle' script that delegates to the
  'body' script. The handle processes an update by pulling a new body script.
  All commands then forward to the body script.

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"
  export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT="/home/docker/data/katas"

3 data sets need to go into their own github repositories.

instructions refactored to be manifest'ed
  use disk[path].each_rdir('instructions') in its make_cache()

refactor Languages to accept the make_cache()'s argument to each_dir() as a parameter.

rename Lanuage(s) to Manifest(s) and create
  super think wrapper classes for Languages,Exercises,Instructions
  which all delegate to Manifests class.

Put two tabs onto the setup/show page.
  One tab for languages, this will have a second step for instructions.
  One tab for exercises.

If there are no images installed handle setup pages gracefully.

-----------------------------------

With James

Setup the new code on James machine.
  o) pull from branch drop-katas-data-container
  o) create new web image
  o) create data folder on docker server from your exercises.
  o) set hard-wired paths to data folders at top of cyber-dojo script.


Agree labels to use for 2 columns in setup/show_exercises page.
  ideally this would become configurable somehow.
  maybe a manifest.json file in the top level folder?
