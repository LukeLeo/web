How to get the data folder(s) onto the server running the docker daemon?

1. create a temporary folder
2. git clone repos into the temp folder
3. create a temporary docker image using the folder as its context
4. issue a docker command to extract the folder from the docker-container

I did before for [cyber-dojo backup] command.
However, that happened inside the web container (in cyber-dojo.rb)
So I think the 'scp' utility (see below) will also need to be
embedded inside cyber-dojo.rb

SCP utility
-----------
sh script to do this will use one parameter,
the name of source folder to copy (on host)

I may also need a [cyber-dojo] script command
to determine if the docker server already has a
given folder - I only want to do the default
folder copying once.

cyber-dojo up exercises=Xpath
cyber-dojo up languages=Lpath

where Lpath and Xpath are local folders.

Or

cyber-dojo languages path
cyber-dojo exercises path
cyber-dojo instructions path

This approach means I don't have to name the destination folder
on the docker server.
What about copying new exercises back from the docker-server, eg for backup

cyber-dojo languages    [push|pull] path
cyber-dojo exercises    [push|pull] path
cyber-dojo instructions [push|pull] path

where path could be a github url, which would do a git clone to get the source.

mkdir tryout
cd tryout
git clone https://github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo.git
cd cyber-dojo
git branch drop-katas-data-container origin/drop-katas-data-container
git checkout drop-katas-data-container

Edited app/docker/cyber-dojo to make two hard-wired env-vars for paths
point to new locations (under tryout)

Tried to create a new server ontop of old one.
Could not do [./cyber-dojo restart]
It complained that cdf-nginx and cdf-web already existed.
Manually deleted them.

Started server.
Failed to create a kata because of permissions.
There is no cyber-dojo user.
On my dev default server
cat /etc/passwd
cyber-dojo:x:19661:19661:Linux User,,,:/home/cyber-dojo:/bin/sh

And this user does not exist on James's machine (Ubuntu)

$ adduser --disabled-password --no-create-home --uid 19661 cyber-dojo

Then

$ cd app/data
$ chown -R cyber-dojo katas

Then could create kata :-)
But problem with no root /cpputest folder (same as I had on my dev macbook)

$ docker run --rm -it cyberdojofoundation/cpp_cpputest sh
$ cd /
$ ls -al

Indeed there is no root folder /cpputest


Tried to recreate gpp_cpputest docker image
There are no Dockerfile's underneath /app/data/languages
.gitignore seems to be the culprit.


Manually added Dockerfile for C++ (g++ 5.3)/CppuTest/_docker_context
rebuilt image
didn't work
There is no user called cyber-dojo *inside* the gpp_cpputest container
Problem is that the image gpp_cpputest is not based FROM user-base
and so does not have cyber-dojo user inside it.






Switched create page to show plain languages
Make katas using C++, CppUTest (and C, CppUTest)
was ok, edited cyber-dojo.sh, /cpputest was there, got a red traffic-light
on the server went to katas/50/5C05.../manifest.json
language:C++ (g++)-CppUTest

Switched create page back to custom exercises.
Made new kata
katas/21/AD6F.../manifest.json
language:C

Aha!!!!
Manually edited the katas manifest.json
to "C++ (g++)-CppUTest"
and it worked. Woooooohoooooo

So the problem is the creation of the kata's manifest.
