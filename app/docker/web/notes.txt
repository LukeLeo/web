How to get the data folder(s) onto the server running the docker daemon?

1. create a temporary folder
2. git clone repos into the temp folder
3. create a temporary docker image using the folder as its context
4. issue a docker command to extract the folder from the docker-container

I did before for [cyber-dojo backup] command.
However, that happened inside the web container (in cyber-dojo.rb)
So I think the 'scp' utility (see below) will also need to be
embedded inside cyber-dojo.rb

SCP utility
-----------
sh script to do this will use one parameter,
the name of source folder to copy (on host)

I may also need a [cyber-dojo] script command
to determine if the docker server already has a
given folder - I only want to do the default
folder copying once.

cyber-dojo up exercises=Xpath
cyber-dojo up languages=Lpath

where Lpath and Xpath are local folders.

Or

cyber-dojo languages path
cyber-dojo exercises path
cyber-dojo instructions path

This approach means I don't have to name the destination folder
on the docker server.
What about copying new exercises back from the docker-server, eg for backup

cyber-dojo languages    [push|pull] path
cyber-dojo exercises    [push|pull] path
cyber-dojo instructions [push|pull] path

where path could be a github url, which would do a git clone to get the source.
