# A runner whose access to the avatar's source files is via a data-container
# containing files for *all* katas/... sub folders.
#
# o) A test-run saves the *changed* visible-files to the avatar's katas/id/ sub-folder.
# o) The shell file then
#     - tar-pipes all of katas/id/ from the data-container into the run-containers /sandbox
#     - executes cyber-dojo.sh in the run-container's sandbox
#     - tar-pipes all of the run-container's /sandbox back to katas/id/ in the data-container
#
# o) State is retained across tests.
# o) Untouched files retain the same date-time stamp.
# o) cyber-dojo.sh can do incremental makes.
#
# The tar-piping is to isolate the avatar's sub-dir in the katas-data-container.
