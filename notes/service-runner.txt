This will need docker installed.
This will also need sudo installed.
It would free the main web image
from having to have docker installed.

Is the runner coupled to the storer?
Not necessarily.
I could have a separate data-container just for running
which does not have a git repo per animal (or a sandbox folder).
This would free the storer from needing to save non
visible-files (.class .o etc).
I could also have a separate runner-container *PER* animal.
This will mean I don't need to tar-pipe.
Remember to be careful about deleting files. If they are
deleted on the browser they have to be deleted in the container too.

The katas storer data-container can remain a single data-container
for *ALL* katas.

A further benefit of this approach is that the downloader
would create much smaller tar files since it would also
volume-mount the shared katas-data-container which would contain
only visible files.
