Documentation for adding a new language.

Server Upgrade
  o) copy disk on cyber-dojo.org
     Current disk is SSD 200GB and is 75% inode full.
     Current spec is 2CPU, 7.5GB.

  o) create new server from disk-copy using Ubuntu 15.10 as base OS
  o) use modified docker-compose.yml
     Need to remove this line from docker-compose.yml
       volumes_from:
         - ${CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_DATA_CONTAINER}:rw
     Need to add this
       volumes:
         - /var/www/cyber-dojo/katas:${CYBER_DOJO_ROOT}/katas:rw

  o) Make sure katas folder had user-rights matching user inside the web container.
     $ userdel cyber-dojo
     $ adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login --uid 19661 cyber-dojo
     $ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
     $ sudo chown -R cyber-dojo:cyber-dojo katas
     $ cd ~
     $ sudo ./cyber-dojo pull all
     $ sudo ./cyber-dojo up

     Need to comment out this line in cyber-dojo.sh
       # one_time_creation_of_katas_data_container

  o) This should hopefully fix the 100% cpu bug I've been occasionally hitting
     See https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/18180

an output file is actually stored in the sandbox of an avatar.
this is not right. it means the avatar cant create an output file
for itself. The output 'file' should only be in the manifest.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If the katas object (saver/storer) can be decoupled from git it could be a big
win for testing as I could then probably re-instate FakeDisk.
I think there are 3 kinds of 'storer'.

1. katas_storer
   Holds manifest.json as a direct copy of start-point info
   which it is then decoupled from.
   Should also have method to colour(output)

2. avatar_storer
   Holds the sandbox which may hold binary files (.class, .so, etc)
   What the avatar's run-test uses (currently tar-piped in-out)
   This could use one volume per avatar. This means I do not need to
   tar-pipe in/out.
   NB: Need to ensure cyber-dojo.sh cannot use docker to volume
       mount another avatar's volume.
   NB: iterating through all the avatars in a kata needs to happen here.
       Eg suppose I have volumes called
           123456789A_lion
           123456789B_hippo
           123456789A_elephant
       Suppose there are 10000's of avatars across all katas.
       I need an efficient way of finding the avatars in kata
       123456789A are [lion, elephant]
       With docker 1.12 there is now at last a --filter option on [docker volume ls]
       So...
           $ docker volume ls --filter name=^123456789A

3. tag_storer
   Holds increments.json which contains date-time-stamp info
   on each traffic-light.
   Also holds one folder per tag which can contain single json
   file holding
     o) visible_files
     o) output
     o) colour (red/amber/green)

I would still need a 'converter' service which would be given a kata id
and would check if this was stored in (current) git format on hard-disk.
If it was it would issue all commands necessary to the storers and then
delete the kata from the hard-disk.
It would need
o) katas mounted
o) link to all 3 storers.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

downloader could also be a new service...
downloader currently returns a zip file of the whole kata with a git repo
per animal.  To decouple this from git I could return a zip in the tag-storer
format (one subdir per tag).
I could insert a shell script file into this zip which (when run) would convert
the unzipped structure it into the current (git) format (it would also check
that git was installed)
Should this be a new service or in the storer?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Possible services
- tag_differ
- tag_storer
- avatar_storer+runner
- kata_storer
- kata_converter
- downloader????

git 2.9+ has new  `--compaction-heuristic`
for improved diffs. Try to get this in place.
(git version in web image is 2.8.3)
Alpine-linux has a package for 2.9.1-r0 (branch=edge, repo=main)

When you do a git tag do you have to supply
user-name and user-email?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Check sandbox folders do *not* contain files such as nunit.framework.dll
which will bloat the tgz file size (such files should be in the docker-image).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Move runners from lib/code to app/lib/code

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

for tests I have to put red_amber_green lambdas (such as bash_unit)
into the output.colour_of. Can this dependency be broken?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

web_base/Dockerfile still has this line
   && cd ${CYBER_DOJO_HOME} ; bundle install --without development test \

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Would be good to have a [cyber-dojo] cli command to export
a specific kata to a given folder. This would make it easier
to create custom exercises. Must not export to default VM
on Mac/Windows quickstart-terminal.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Make [cyber-dojo clean] remove dead containers as well as dead images?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Add C# XUnit test framework.
http://xunit.github.io/

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Note that upgrading Dockerfiles and images might break cyber-dojo.sh
files since paths can be different...
Does the cyber-dojo.sh file belong to the image rather than the start-point?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

un-hardwire setting of 2 core env-vars in cyber-dojo script.
  export CYBER_DOJO_DATA_ROOT="/home/docker/data"
  export CYBER_DOJO_KATAS_ROOT="/home/docker/data/katas"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

cyber-dojo.rb failure messages are
FAILED: ....
Check what [docker] does and mimic that.
$ docker images --ssss
flag provided but not defined: --ssss
See 'docker images --help'.
Test these with shunit2 tests.

app_controllers tests has this warning
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/activesupport-4.1.0/lib/active_support/values/time_zone.rb:285: warning: circular argument reference - now
Tried upgrading to Ruby 4.2.6
solves this as long Gemfile.lock is not part of the docker context
(remove it from web's dockerignore file)
This causes a few app_controller deprecation warnings
and a load of app_controller test fails which seem to be due to bad URLs

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Occasional test failures (when run locally)...
  ForkerControllerTest#test_'EAE021',
    when language no longer exists, the fork fails, and the reason given is language
  SetupControllerTest#test_'EB77D9',
    show_exercises page uses cached exercises that are runnable

  Tests are defintely not unit-tests and almost certainly have order
  dependencies. State of cache files. How to resolve?

  I could reinstate FakeDisk, leave env-vars for data ROOTs, then
  fill FakeDisk with known content, then do access to dojo methods
  such as dojo.exercises

  For now, deleting caches at start of app_controller tests.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Note: need a check that each docker image has a user in it called nobody
      (I don't think it's uid is important)

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) get travis to push images to cdf hub?
   push images to cyberdojofoundation hub if tests pass

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

)) add confirmation diagnostic to each [cyber-dojo] command?

----------------------------------------

Features James mentioned during our chat
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

feature: only one error in C/C++ projects

feature: replace duration on dashboard with time-ticks on top of minute columns.

feature: sed in the editor (search and replace)

feature: on enter page, when kata id is entered and buttons become enabled
         it would be nice to see the display_name in the footer.

feature: copy one animal to a new one (keeping whole traffic-light history)

feature: fork giving two options, viz create new kata and create start-point

feature: hovering over a traffic-light gives more detail, viz for changed files (not output)
         name of file, no of deleted lines, no of added lines

feature: traffic-lights have some visual indication if there is a
         "suspiciously large change"
         eg more than 1 file changed
         eg more than 3 lines changed in a non-test file

feature: hyperlink of compiler error on output to file and line number

feature: colour syntax?
