The cyber-dojo web server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojo/web

To rebuild the web image and run all the tests inside it
$ cd test
$ ./build_up_test.sh

You can also run the tests from inside the running web server...
$ cd cli
$ ./cyber-dojo sh
$ cd test && ./run.sh

Running the tests locally (not inside a web container) is no longer supported.
