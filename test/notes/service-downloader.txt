downloader currently returns a zip file of the *whole* kata with a git repo
per animal. This includes files such as the .class file in a Java kata.
It would be better to recreate the folder structure holding only
the visible files.

one of the issues with the download functionality is that I do
not delete the tar files after they've been downloaded. If the
creation of the tar file happened inside a container spun up just
do do the download then the tar file would be automatically deleted!
