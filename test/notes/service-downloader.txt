downloader currently returns a zip file of the *whole* kata with a git repo
per animal. This includes files such as the .class file in a Java kata.
It would be better to recreate the folder structure holding only
the visible files.

one of the issues with the download functionality is that I do
not delete the tar files after they've been downloaded. If the
creation of the tar file happened inside a container spun up just
do do the download then the tar file would be automatically deleted!

Also, if the storer migrates to a format where the individual visible
files are not stored (since the differ now does diffing) then I need
to make sure that a downloaded tgz file can be imported into the katas
data-container and it will be ok. A nice solution here might be that
the migrater (coupled to the storer) could recognize the old-style
format and migrate it to the new manifest only format - where individual
visible files are not stored, after all the visible files are held
inside the manifest per tag commit anyway!
