But for now the simplest is to simply create one 'storer' than still uses
git and behave exactly the same as the current host_disk_katas.rb
This is also the simplest step to get a migrater service running.

Main issue with katas-data-container is that you cannot rsync from one server
to another. Check how this affects backups too.

------------------------------------------------------------

currently the katas/ID subfolder has a manifest.json file which records
visible_files, viz names and contents.
This is the manifest for the kata not for the animal.
The idea is you can start a new animal without having to go back
to the start-points (which may have changed).
