Idea for Better design...
-------------------------

a start-point file contains a json list like this
{
  "Java,JUnit"  => URL/DIR,
  "C++, assert" => URL/DIR
}

and each language+test combination has their own dedicated
github repo which *combines* the Dockerfile and the initial
visible_files.

Down side of this is that the DIR bit is now
trickier to handle in a cross-platform independent way...

Pass start-point file to commander, it returns list of
base dirs that have to be copied into a volume.
Local host does that and passes name of volume to commander.
