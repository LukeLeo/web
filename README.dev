The cyber-dojo web server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojofoundation/web
The script to build this image is
app/docker/web/build-image.sh

If you're running this image and you make a change to local source files the
changes will not be seen inside the server of course. You'll need to recreate
the web image...
$ cd web/docker/web
$ ./build-image.sh

then bring down the old server and bring up the new one...
$ cd cli
$ ./cyber-dojo down
$ ./cyber-dojo up

You can run the tests from inside the running web server...
$ cd cli
$ ./cyber-dojo sh
$ cd test && ./run.sh
