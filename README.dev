The cyber-dojo web server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojo/web

To rebuild the image and run all the tests inside it
$ cd cli
$ ./build_and_test.sh

You can run the tests from inside the running web server...
$ cd cli
$ ./cyber-dojo sh
$ cd test && ./run.sh

If you make changes to local source files the changes will not be seen inside
the server. You'll need to rebuild the image and bring up the new server...
$ cd web/docker/web
$ ./build-image.sh
$ cd cli
$ ./cyber-dojo up
