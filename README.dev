The cyber-dojo server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojofoundation/web
The script to build this image is
cyber-dojo/app/docker/web/build-image.sh

If you're running this image and you make a change to local source files the
changes will not be seen inside the server of course. You'll need to recreate
the web image, then bring down the old server and bring up the new one.
$ cd cyber-dojo/app/docker/web
$ ./build-image.sh
$ cd cyber-dojo/app/docker
$ ./cyber-dojo down
$ ./cyber-dojo up

You can run the tests from inside the running web server. First shell in
$ ./cyber-dojo sh
$ cd test && ./run.sh
