Ensure a git clone of the main cyber-dojo server repository
include an empty downloads folder.

An (initially) empty downloads folder is needed if you are running
a local cyber-dojo server (using script/dev-server.sh)

An empty downloads folder is also needed if you are running
a dockerized cyber-dojo server (using app/docker/cyber-dojo)
See app/docker/web/.dockerignore
