- The main web-server micro-service for [cyber-dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org).
- Uses the [runner](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/runner) to run each avatar's tests.
- Uses the [storer](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/storer) to save the code/tests associated with each avatar's test.
- Uses the [differ](https://github.com/cyber-dojo/differ) to diff the code/tests in successive avatar's tests.
